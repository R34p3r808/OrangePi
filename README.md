# OrangePi
Setting up Proxmox on Orange Pi 16 GB with 256 SSD NVMe/8 core.

Some of the VMs hosted on the virualization platform will be for TOR/Dark web research and for detection engineering testing.

Potential OS to load llama/mistral onto it for localized AI testing, etc.


1. Loaded on a debian bullseye image from the orange pi site
2. Changed orangepi-config to boot from nvme instead of sd card
3. Loaded pimox onto the pi for a customized version of proxmox for SBCs.
4. ProxMox is now hosted on my private network for hosting multiple virtual machines.

Case was installed as well as heatsinks on the memory/RAM and CPU chips.  Fan is also installed to keep the chips and SSD cool enough for smooth operation.
